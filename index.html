        <h2>About Me</h2> <!-- heading for the about me section -->
        <p>
            I am a passionate and dedicated second-year Computer Science student at the University of Adelaide, with a strong interest in software development and problem-solving. My coursework in data structures, algorithm analysis, operating systems, and computer systems has equipped me with the ability to understand and apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past few years, I have independently developed multiple projects that have strengthened my technical skills and creativity. Notably, I built a fully functional Sudoku game in C++ using Raylib and CMake, incorporating an interactive GUI and complex algorithms like backtracking. Additionally, I developed a Bank Management System that helped me master object-oriented programming by implementing secure and efficient core functionalities. Currently, I am working on a 3D Chess game, focusing on advanced GUI programming and algorithm optimization. Alongside this, I am also building a personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and technical expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond academics and personal projects, I actively participate in programming competitions and community coding events. My involvement with the Computer Science and Competitive Programming Club, along with intensive training programs like Ravi’s Study Program, has helped me sharpen my problem-solving skills, master new technologies, and prepare for technical interviews. These experiences have also enhanced my teamwork, communication, and time management abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am eager to apply my academic knowledge and project experience in a professional setting. I am currently seeking a **Software Engineer Internship**, where I can contribute my C++ expertise while continuing to grow as a software engineer by working on modern development projects in a collaborative team environment.
